Game space (Raw input enabled replays) is lossless for every single frame where any key is being held, for the frames with no key inputs the x/y coordinates are quantised to a lower resolution - an imperceptible change but it can easily be removed.

Screen space is technically 'gainful' compression, as it fixes the slight rounding issue present in the original OSR

All other formats are entirely lossless.
